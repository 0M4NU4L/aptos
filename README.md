SimpleVoting Module

ðŸ“„ Project Description
SimpleVoting is a Move smart contract deployed on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to create and participate in decentralized voting polls. Each poll is created with a set of options, and participants can cast a single vote. Once a user has voted, they cannot vote again, and the contract enforces that the poll must be active to allow participation.

Key Features:

Create a poll with multiple options.

Enforce single vote per user.

Store votes and voter records on-chain.

Allow only active polls to accept votes.

ðŸŒŸ Project Vision
The goal of the SimpleVoting project is to provide a lightweight, transparent, and trustless voting system on the Aptos blockchain. It aims to:

Empower community-driven decisions without a central authority.

Offer tamper-proof and verifiable voting records.

Encourage more on-chain governance mechanisms for DAOs and decentralized applications.

ðŸ”® Future Scope
Add poll expiration timestamps.

Allow users to close polls manually or automatically.

Add event logging for poll creation and vote casting.

Implement result querying and winner calculation logic.

Add support for poll visibility (public/private polls).

Integrate with front-end dApps for user-friendly interaction.
