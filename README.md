# 🗳 SimpleVoting Module

## 📄 Project Description  
*SimpleVoting* is a Move smart contract deployed on the *Aptos blockchain* that enables users to create and participate in decentralized voting polls.  

Each poll is initialized with a list of options, and participants are allowed to cast a *single vote. Once a vote is cast, it cannot be changed or duplicated. The contract ensures that **only active polls* accept votes, providing a secure and reliable voting experience.

### 🔑 Key Features
- ✅ Create polls with customizable voting options  
- ✅ Enforce *one vote per user*  
- ✅ Store all votes and voter records *on-chain*  
- ✅ Accept votes *only while the poll is active*
